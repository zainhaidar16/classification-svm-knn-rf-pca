# Multi-Model Classification with PCA

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://classification-svm-knn-rf-pca.streamlit.app/)

This repository contains a Streamlit app that demonstrates multi-model classification using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on various datasets. The app allows you to select a dataset and a classifier, input your values, and get a prediction.

### Datasets

The app supports the following datasets:

- Wine: This dataset contains information about different types of wines.
- Breast Cancer: This dataset contains information about breast cancer tumors.
- Iris: This dataset contains information about different species of iris flowers.

### Classifiers

The app supports the following classifiers:

- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- Random Forest

### Installation

To run the app on your own machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the app using the following command:

```
$ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app will start running on your local machine, and you can access it by opening your web browser and navigating to the provided URL.

### Customization

Feel free to modify the app according to your needs. You can change the styling, add more classifiers or datasets, or even extend the functionality.
